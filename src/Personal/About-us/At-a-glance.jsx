                      <br />
                      It all started in 1838...
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      A group of traders, led by James Blyth, see the need for a
                      second bank in Mauritius. They establish &#39;La Banque
                      Commerciale de Maurice&#39; which starts business on 1
                      September 1838 in premises situated at the Rue de Paris
                      (now Sir Seewoosagur Street) in the capital, Port Louis.
                      In 1839, Queen Victoria grants a Royal Charter to the
                      newly established bank for a period of twenty years under
                      the name of &#39;The Mauritius Commercial Bank&#39; (MCB).
                      The charter is renewed every twenty years until 18 August
                      1955 when the Bank becomes a limited liability company.
                      Five years later, it moves to the current location of its
                      headquarters at Sir William Newton Street (at the time,
                      Rue de l&#39;Eglise).

                    <p>
                      The first hundred years are rough and the Bank encounters
                      serious financial difficulties on several occasions. In
                      spite of various national financial crises, fierce
                      competition over the years from ten other commercial
                      banks, two world wars and natural catastrophes, MCB
                      succeeds in expanding its activities, trebles its capital
                      and opens its first branch in Curepipe in 1920.

                    <p>
                      Curepipe is the first step in the weaving of a nationwide
                      network. MCB has become the first bank to set up branches
                      in rural locations: Mah√©bourg in 1955, Flacq in 1958,
                      Triolet in 1959, Goodlands in 1963... Today, the network
                      consists of 40 strategically located branches and helps
                      assert the Bank&#39;s leadership in the retail market.

                      MCB has always been dedicated to helping people with ideas
                      become entrepreneurs and businesses grow. The Group has
                      been the lynchpin of the country&#39;s economic
                      development. Drawing on its intimate local knowledge and
                      business relations, the Bank has supported agriculture,
                      trade and industry. Since the country&#39;s independence
                      in 1968, however, the Bank has amplified its response to
                      the more varied and diverse needs of the country. MCB has
                      thus been crucial in ensuring the take-off of a number of
                      sectors which were, at inception, considered either
                      unfashionable or risky. From tourism to textiles, local
                      manufacturing to Freeport activities, from information
                      &amp; communication technology (ICT) to seafood, MCB has
                      always been present to support bright ideas and turn
                      fledgling segments into pillars of the economy.
