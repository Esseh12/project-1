                  cookies used therein, to accept some of them only or to
                  decline all of them. If you have not been provided this option
                  during the current visit, it means that you already responded

                <h3>Cookie</h3>
                <p>
                  A cookie is a small text file which may be placed on your
                  device (e.g. computer, smartphones, tablets) through your web
                  browser, when you visit a website. When a website is accessed,
                  one or more cookies may be stored on your device and are used
                  during subsequent visits to the same website. Cookies are very
                  common and used by most websites. Each cookie typically stores
                  the name of the domain from which it was downloaded, its
                  lifetime and an associated value.
                </p>
                <h3>Purpose of Cookies</h3>

                </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                    First-party cookies: These cookies are set by our own
                    website and are typically used for website performance and

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Third-party cookies: These are placed on your device by
                    third-parties, which provide specific services to us. While
                    we have allowed these third-parties to use our website to

                <h3>Lifetime of Cookies on Your Device</h3>
                <p>
                  Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of
                  time. Based on their lifetime, cookies can be classified into
                  the following:
                </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                    Session cookies: These cookies exist only for as long as you
                    use your web browser or session. They are automatically
                    deleted by the browser when you close it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Persistent cookies: These cookies remain on your device even
                    after your browser is closed.

                <h3>Opting-out of Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>
                  We use Google Analytics for tracking website usage and this
                  service is provided by a third-party, which is Google
                  Corporation. Although limited information is gathered by the
                  Google Analytics platform, you can opt out of having your data
                  captured on this platform by installing the Google Analytics
                  Opt-out Browser Add-on. Refer to
                  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
                </p>
                <h3>Matching Cookies Data With Other Identifiers</h3>
                <p>
                  We do not link information gathered through cookies with other
                  direct personal identifiers (e.g. your name, email address,
                  telephone number).
