                        Check that the web address is what you were expected.
                        The safest way to have access to any site is to type its
                        web address directly into the browser. That’s why we
                        urge you to always access MCB Internet Banking through
                        www.mcb.mu and log in from there.&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Always log out your MCB Internet Banking session and
                        close your browser when you have completed your
                        banking.&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Never access MCB Internet Banking from a link in an
                        e-mail or from redirections from other websites -
                        genuine emails from MCB will NOT contain any links to
                        our internet banking service.&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Never provide sensitive information in response to any
                        e-mail, even if the e-mail looks like it comes from a
                        genuine financial institution like MCB. No MCB staff
                        will ask you for your Internet Banking credentials. We
                        will never claim your account may be closed if you fail
                        to confirm, verify or authenticate your personal
                        information via email.&nbsp;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Never respond to e-mails that request personal and
                        financial information and never click on a link in such
                        e-mails! This may take you to a spoof website. MCB will
                        never ask you to fill out any survey in exchange of
                        money or ask you to provide your account number so you
                        can be rewarded. In case you’ve received a suspicious

                                  Before making a banking transaction online,
                                  make sure the site you’re accessing is
                                  legitimate.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  It’s important that you be careful of who you
                                  trust online. Ensure that the website you are
                                  visiting is genuine and secure, prior making a
                                  payment or share sensitive information. We’ve
                                  listed some signs you should look for.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Anytime you are about to log in to an Internet
                                  Banking session or make any kind of
                                  transaction online, you should expect to see
                                  some security indications. These are the Green
                                  Bar, the closed padlock and ‘https://&#39;
                                  displayed in the address bar, present on all
                                  genuine transactional sites.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Look at the URL of the website in your
                                  browser&#39;s address bar. If it starts with
                                  &#39;https://&#39;, it means that the site is
                                  using a SSL Certificate and is hence secured.
                                  The SSL Certificate secures the information.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Look for a closed padlock icon in the address
                                  bar; it indicates encryption is being used on
                                  the web page. The icon is located on the left
                                  of the URL on most recent browsers, but may
                                  vary in location on older ones.
                                </p>

                                  On our site, look for the Green Address Bar
                                  displaying &#39;The Mauritius Commercial Bank
                                  Limited&#39; - this is a clear visual cue that
                                  you have reached the legitimate MCB Website,
                                  and that your connection is encrypted and safe
                                  to submit your personal and financial
                                  information.

                                  If you reach a website and get a warning that
                                  the site cannot be trusted, it might be an
                                  indication of forgery. We recommend not to
                                  submit any private information through. If the
                                  website is owned by a reputable company,
                                  validate this behavior with them. We also
                                  encourage you to look out for poor grammar or
                                  spelling on sites and check that the design is
                                  consistent as this may be an indication of

                                  Your passwords are the keys to your personal

                                  Malicious people are always lurking to sneak
                                  into your devices and get hold of your bank
                                  accounts. Your passwords are valuable so make
                                  sure to protect them. We’ve compiled a few
                                  tips to help you safeguard your password.

                                    Choose a high-strength password not based on
                                    guessable information like birth dates,
                                    phone numbers, names, etc. and, prefer a
                                    combination of letters, both lowercase and
                                    uppercase, numbers and symbols. This will
                                    make it harder to guess.

                                    same password for IB and social networks
                                    applications such as Facebook, LinkedIn,

                                    likely to be a virus and should never be
                                    opened. Files extension like - .exe - .pif -
                                    .vbs are commonly used to propagate viruses.

                                    Always use secured wireless connections
                                    which make use of encryption to handle
                                    private/sensitive information online. There
                                    are 3 main encryption levels available -
                                    WEP, WPA, WPA2, the latter being the
                                    highest. With an encrypted connection, you
                                    will be prompted to enter a &#39;key&#39;.
                                    Using an unsecured public Wi-Fi would allow
                                    unauthorised people to intercept any
                                    information while you are online. There is
                                    also the risk that someone creates a spoof
                                    hotspot which fools you into thinking that
                                    it is the legitimate one.

                                  Chances are social networking has become an
                                  integral part of your online activities. You
                                  may use it to stay in touch with friends,
                                  family and businesses, share experiences and
                                  content, and its potential is growing. But,
                                  with these remarkable capabilities come
                                  several risks. Hackers use the same
                                  opportunities in an environment where guard is
                                  relatively low to boost their existing acts –
                                  distribute malwares, gather your personal
                                  information and more.

                                  Be wary of any unusual posts. Be sceptical
                                  about what you read online, criminals may post
                                  misleading information to make you feel
                                  deceptively confident.

                                  Be cautious when providing your personal
                                  information on social networking sites, as
                                  remember that, the more information is
                                  available about you online the easier it is
                                  for fraudsters to steal your identify.
                                  Personal Information could also serve social
                                  engineering attacks to target people - often
                                  young ones - to meet them in person, which
                                  could lead to life threatening situations.
                                  Increasingly, social media is being used by
                                  malicious people to track potential victims’
                                  whereabouts.

                                  data, like how much information your friends
                                  will see.
