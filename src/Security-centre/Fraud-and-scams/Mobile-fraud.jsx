                      Mobile devices have taken over computers in popularity due
                      to the high range of functionalities they offer. They have
                      become an integral part to our daily lives. The high level
                      of convenience it provides us comes with its own risks.
                      Hackers get more creative too in their methods to con
                      victims, capture personal information and rob money. It’s
                      important to be aware of the different types of mobile
                      scams. Take a look at some of the most popular ones.

                    <h2>SMiShing</h2>
                    <p>
                      Short for SMS Phishing, occurs when a fraudster sends an
                      SMS to an individual in an attempt to get them to divulge
                      personal or financial information. The user is usually
                      tricked into downloading a Trojan horse, virus,
                      eavesdropping software or other malware onto his mobile
                      device.

                    <h2>Fake Mobile Apps</h2>
                    <p>
                      Those are increasingly being seen in the Cyber landscape
                      and they are designed to steal online banking credentials.
                      Currently, a pair of malware, Android/FakeBankDropper.A
                      and Android/FakeBank.A are widely being spread and spoof
                      legitimate apps.

                    </div>
                    <h2>One-Ring Scam</h2>
                    <p>
                      This is when scammers use auto-dialers to target phone
                      numbers across the world. These calls disconnect after one
                      ring only, enough for the user to get a missed call
                      notification. If you return the call, usually fraudsters
                      keep you on the line and you get charged hefty fees.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Recorded Message Scam</h2>
                    <p>
                      Similar to one-ring scams but those frauds leave you
                      voicemails that prompt you to return a call regarding a
                      prize you allegedly have won. if you call back, you will
                      be charged with significant fees.
                    </p>
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Subscriber Fraud</h2>
                    <p>
                      This happens when a person gains access to your personal
                      information and contracts a mobile phone account in your
                      name. The criminal can amass a huge bill before a victim
                      becomes aware of the con.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <br />
                    </div>
                    <h2>SIM-Swap Scam</h2>
                    <p>
                      A genuine service in some countries that allow you to
                      transfer your existing mobile number to a brand new SIM
                      card of any size, even at different service providers.
                      Unfortunately, fraudsters have identified a significant
                      vulnerability in the way banks are using customers’
                      mobiles to identify them – and are using SIM-Swap as a
                      technique that provide them with the ability to utilise a
                      victim’s mobile phone number. This helps them in
                      benefiting from all functionalities and services the phone
                      would provide. This includes making phone calls, sending
                      and receiving SMS. Such practices involve receiving login
                      or transaction confirmation from big companies like MCB,
                      Apple, Google and more. Such scams may allow fraudsters to
                      take control of your mobile number.
