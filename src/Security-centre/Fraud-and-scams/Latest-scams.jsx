                                  processors was newly discovered by
                                  researchers. The flaw is said to impact almost
                                  every computer with an Intel processor since
                                  2011. The bug could allow attackers to steal
                                  any bit of raw data that’s been regularly
                                  accessed by the processor like passwords,
                                  browsing information or, provide the means to

                                  ZombieLoad is the latest in a string of
                                  security flaws that leverage a widely used
                                  feature called the &#39;speculative
                                  execution&#39;, wherein a processor works to
                                  predict operations or data an application or
                                  system may need in the future. The result
                                  (data) is kept in the short-term memory caches
                                  of CPUs. That’s where the problem lies… the
                                  flaw allows attackers to read the data
                                  directly from the processor memory caches.

                                  should ensure their intel-based devices are

                                  In a nutshell, this fraud happens when a
                                  company is tricked into changing bank account
                                  details for a significant payment. Fraudsters
                                  normally analyse the business relationship
                                  between the targeted companies, hack a
                                  business’s email account to find a customer
                                  invoice which they copy, modify with their
                                  bank details, and—at the right time - poses as
                                  the usual supplier, and make a formal request
                                  to the customer to pay into the fraudulent
                                  account. The request, often, with a sense of
                                  urgency - so you don’t have time to give much
                                  thought to it - may also come with a
                                  justifying explanation like, the usual bank
                                  account is under audit.

                                    fraudsters can make any phone number appear
                                    on an handset. Confirm the email or call

                                    Always look out for any irregularities on

                                    details, amount or address. Be suspicious if
                                    it differs from the last time you used it
