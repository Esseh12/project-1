                      Card fraud occurs when someone gets your card details and
                      uses them to make purchases in your name on the internet
                      or over the phone.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Skimming</h2>
                      <p>
                        A technique to record the details from the magnetic
                        strip of your card by means of a device that fraudsters
                        have illegally attached to an ATM. A miniature camera is
                        also placed to overlook the PIN pad to capture you
                        entering your PIN. The criminal can then use the details
                        to create a counterfeit credit card. Skimming can also
                        happen at retailers or restaurants. Handheld devices are
                        used to skim your credit card during a normal
                        transaction.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Shimming</h2>
                      <p>
                        This operates much like skimming in that the purpose of
                        such fraud is to collect data embedded into the credit
                        card. Hackers make use of a thin device - almost
                        unnoticeable by a user - that is shimmed into the slot
                        of the ATM&#39;s card reader or point-of-sale (POS)
                        device. It then records the data on the chip as it is
                        read by the appliance. The device must be extracted from
                        the appliance for thieves to retrieve the data.

                      <h2>Card Trapping Devices</h2>
                      <p>
                        A technique using a device on the ATM to capture your
                        card. Fraudsters may trick you into re-entering your PIN
                        while they record it. The fraudster will then wait while
                        you leave the ATM premises to remove the device and your
                        card and use your card as they wish.&nbsp;
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                    <div>
                      <h2>Shoulder Surfing</h2>
                      <p>
                        That simply happens when crooks spy on you to obtain
                        your personal credentials, when you enter them on an
                        ATM, computer or other electronic device. This is done
                        easily while standing next to the person being observed
                        or can be done long distance with the aid of binoculars
                        or other vision-enhancing device. During a card fraud at
                        an ATM, the fraudster will also try to trick you to get
                        your bank card by diverting your attention, and
                        thereafter, he will be free use both the card and PIN to
                        withdraw money from your account.&nbsp;
                      </p>

                    <div>
                      <h2>Phantom Withdrawal</h2>
                      <p>
                        This fraud involves the unauthorised removal of funds
                        from a bank account using an ATM, by means of a victim’s
                        card and PIN. A typical scenario would involve a stolen
                        card used at an ATM with a genuine PIN, either obtained
                        by theft or illicit observation. The card can also be
                        cloned.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Cards Cracking</h2>
                      <p>
                        This fraud scheme involving the unauthorised use of
                        account information, is becoming widespread as
                        fraudsters are targeting their victims - usually young
                        people in need of money - via social media using
                        advertisements of fake contests or scholarships.
                        Fraudsters convince their victim to share their account
                        information then deposit counterfeited cheques and
                        quickly make withdrawals before the bank figures out the
                        cheques are phony. The cheque bounces as it isn’t backed
                        up by money, funds were withdrawn by the scammers and,
                        usually the victim is then responsible to pay the money
                        They’ve, by choice, given their information out hence
                        authorised the use of their account.
