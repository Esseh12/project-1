                      Most online frauds use technological advances to lure
                      their victims. Malwares, short for malicious software,
                      includes viruses, trojans, spyware and are designed to
                      infiltrate a computer in view to rob information and
                      perpetrate fraud.&nbsp; The more information you have the
                      easier it is to protect yourself against those criminals.
                      What follows is an overview of some common types of frauds
                      tol help you avoid falling prey to scam.

                    <h2>Identity Theft</h2>
                    <p>
                      Your identity is a personal collection of confidential
                      data meant for your own purposes. Identity theft occurs
                      when someone acquires a piece of your personal information
                      including name, date of birth, address. This can take
                      place whether the victim is alive or deceased. The theft
                      of your identity with the intention of committing frauds
                      is an offence punishable by law.&nbsp;

                    <h2>Phishing</h2>
                    <p>
                      A fraudulent act where seemingly credible e-mails, text
                      messages and pop-up messages are sent to users claiming to
                      be from reputable financial institutions, retailers,
                      credit card companies, e-commerce site, etc. Those
                      fraudulent, but official-looking e-mails typically contain
                      a hyperlink to a forged website in an attempt to con users
                      into divulging to enter personal details, like usernames,
                      password, security details, card details, and so on. Once
                      you provide your information, it can be used on legitimate
                      sites to rob you.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <br />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      Generally, messages from phishing scams often use a sense
                      of urgency to induce the user into taking action.
                      Fraudsters also happen to lure victims into filling an
                      online banking survey with a monetary reward at the end.
                      These surveys are often sent through e-mails. Phishers
                      also use phone and SMS to con users into providing
                      sensitive information.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <br />
                    </div>
                    <h2>Virus Hoaxes Mail</h2>
                    <p>
                      False reports about non-existent viruses. Virus Hoaxes
                      warn online users of dangerous viruses through e-mails and
                      invite them to forward these messages to their network.
                      These techniques are sometimes initiated to gather mass
                      e-mail data for spam use.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <h2>Email Hacking</h2>
                    <p>
                      Email messages with a forged sender address to mislead the
                      recipient about the origin of the message. Such emails are
                      intended to defraud the receiver in inciting the latter to
                      send money to a “relative/friend/supplier” for payment.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                      <br />
                    </div>
                    <h2>Social Networking Scams</h2>
                    <p>
                      Scammers make use of social media in their effort to
                      appear legitimate by hiding behind anonymity, and easily
                      reaching a mass audience at low cost. They are
                      increasingly harvesting information from social networking
                      sites to gather valuable details about their victims that
                      will make spear phishing attacks more likely to succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      People are often befriended on Facebook and made to
                      believe that they will receive a loan, or a parcel (by
                      post) containing money and valuable gifts or above market
                      rates of return on investment in crypto/ other assets. To
                      that effect they are made to pay a clearance fee/
                      administration/processing fee in respect of the above
                      promises, or convinced to disclose their credentials to
                      the fraudster.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Cyberstalking</h2>
                    <p>
                      Criminals make use of today&#39;s technology advances to
                      harass people through the use of the internet and other
                      electronic means. That involves identity theft, data
                      manipulations, monitoring, threats, defamation and more.
                      Usually, cyberstalking includes sending harassing emails,
                      instant messages, sms, or social media posts and even the
                      creation of websites, for the sole purpose of distressing
                      the victim. An online stalker can ruin the life of a
                      victim, both online and offline.

                    <h2>Ransomware Scam</h2>
                    <p>
                      This is a fast-growing online threat that take your
                      computer or smartphone in hostage by means of a malware,
                      wiping out or encrypting your files, then attempt to
                      extort payment to regain your files. The user is usually
                      duped into clicking on a link leading to an infected
                      website or clicking into an infected advertising.
