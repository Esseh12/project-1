                      Using your cards is a very convenient way to make payments
                      nowadays including online. Unfortunately, this convenience
                      also carries a degree of risk which can be meaningfully
                      prevented with some simple precautions. Below is a set of
                      guidelines to help you secure your cards.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Monitor your Statements: Check your statements to verify
                      that they match your usage. Keep your receipts in safe
                      location until you reconcile your credit card statements,
                      then shred and discard them. Report any incorrect
                      transactions immediately or within 45 days of the
                      Statement date.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Go Paperless: Register to e-statements to receive your
                      statements through our Internet Banking (IB) platform or
                      our mobile app, JuiceByMCB. It’s a secure and convenient
                      way to have access to your card statements! Once you have
                      registered to e-statements, a notification email will be
                      sent to you each time a new statement is available on IB /
                      Juice. You will then be able to view, download, and print
                      your statements, at your own convenience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Secure a list of your Cards: Keep a list of your cards
                      numbers in a safe place as well as keep handy the MCB
                      Cards Call Centre Number, for immediate reporting, in case
                      of loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Endorse your card: Sign the signature panel of your card
                      immediately upon receipt.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Secure your Code: When you receive your PIN by mail from
                      us, memorize it and destroy the PIN mailer. If the PIN
                      mailer wasn’t received intact, please do let us know
                      immediately. If you change it, select one that is not
                      easily guessed or that can be associated to you. If you do
                      keep any record of your PIN, make sure it is separate from
                      your card, and in disguise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Use ATMs Safely: Always be cautious when using ATMs.
                      Protect the ATM keypad with your hand and/or body while
                      keying in your PIN. Secure your card and cash after
                      completing your transaction and before walking away from
                      the ATM area. Avoid using ATMs at odd hours more
                      specifically when you are alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Travelling precautions: Keep us informed of your trips
                      abroad including a travel itinerary, if possible and
                      provide us your overseas contact details so we can get in
                      touch with you whenever necessary, for example, in case of
                      suspicious transactions.
