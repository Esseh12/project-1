                      While fraud is on the rise and criminals are becoming more
                      sophisticated, we continually endeavour to put in place
                      rigorous measures to reduce associated risks. Our priority
                      is to protect the integrity of your transactions. Here’s
                      what we do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Chip Card: Get stronger security for your credit and debit
                      card with chip technology that protects your information
                      when used at a chip-enabled terminal. The embedded
                      microchips make it more difficult for cards details to be
                      fraudulently copied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Safer Online Shopping: MCB is an active participant in
                      Verified by Visa® and MasterCard SecureCode® via its MCB
                      Secure service. This service requires that you
                      authenticate yourself when you use your MCB cards online.
                      You can shop online with complete peace of mind knowing
                      that when you make a purchase with your MCB Credit Card at
                      participating merchants, your MCB Credit Card is protected
                      from unauthorised use.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Fraud Monitoring: MCB uses mechanisms that rigorously
                      monitors how and where your card is being used, in view to
                      detect any irregular activity and block potential fraud.
                      If abnormal patterns are detected, our fraud team will get
                      in touch with you to verify same or will block the
                      transaction if deemed necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ATMs Monitoring: Our ATMs network is equipped with
                      surveillance cameras which help close monitoring, and
                      allow us to take measures if any unusual activity is
                      detected. We have reinforced skimming protection.
