                    <h2>Secure access to the management of your accounts</h2>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Login password</strong>: Upon your first
                      registration on MCB Internet Banking, a user ID and
                      password will be issued to you. For security purposes,
                      please change your password and keep it only to yourself.
                      If you opt to transact online, you will either be provided
                      a transactional password or a security token, depending on
                      the option that you have selected.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Additional Layer of Security</h3>
                    <p>
                      To help safeguard against unauthorized access to your
                      accounts, we provide you an additional layer of protection
                      by means of a ‘security token’ or a ‘mobile
                      one-time-password’ mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Security token</strong>: You may choose to use the
                      Soft Token - an application which needs to be downloaded
                      on your smartphone -, or the Hard Token - a small
                      electronic device (which looks like a calculator). Both
                      options will help generate a one-time password (OTP) which
                      you will need to insert when authorising online
                      transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>When and how to use it</strong> : A 7-digit number
                      will display on your screen at the final stage of your
                      payment. After switching on your token and entering your
                      token PIN, type in the 7-digit number and click on the
                      “Challenge-Response” button for the Soft Token, or “on”
                      for the Hard Token.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>One Time Password (OTP)</strong>: It’s a
                      highly-secure automatically generated validation code,
                      sent to your mobile phone, to authenticate you for a
                      single transaction online. The OTP must never be disclose
                      to any third parties.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Secure Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Encryption</strong>: Encryption helps create a
                      secure environment for the information being transferred
                      between your browser and the Bank’s server. This security
                      feature helps prevent unauthorized access that is,
                      fraudulent users to read or amend your private data while
                      being transmitted online. MCB is using high-end encryption
                      technology to protect the privacy and confidentiality of
                      your information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Digital certificate</strong>: A digital
                      certificate tells you that the site you are visiting is
                      genuine. MCB uses the highest level Extended Validation
                      (EV) Certificate available on the market to make it easier
                      for you to protect yourself online. When a site uses EV
                      certificates, you&#39;ll know it is authentic when the
                      address bar turns green, displaying the name of the
                      Institution as well as the Issuer’s name. Always check
                      your browser address bar for the Green Bar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Firewall</strong>: MCB uses a firewall mechanism
                      to prevent unauthorized access to and from its information
                      network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Automatic Timeout</strong>: A timeout allows the
                      system to log you off the transaction window if there is
                      no activity within approximately 15 mins. This reduces the
                      risk of fraudulent access if you happen to leave your
                      computer unattended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Temporary denial of access</strong>: Three
                      consecutive failed attempts to log in will temporarily
                      disable your online access. You will have to reset your
                      password by contacting the MCB on +230 202 6060. This is a
                      dissuasive measure to prevent fraudulent users to attempt
                      a fake password.
