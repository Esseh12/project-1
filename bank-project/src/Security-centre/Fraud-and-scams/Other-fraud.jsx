                      With the countless advances in technology that enhance our
                      daily lives in many ways including banking, we also see
                      recurrent criminal threats striking the financial
                      industry. Fraudsters are improving their methods and we
                      need to join forces to spot fraud attacks and proactively
                      protect your money from unethical activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We want to increase your awareness of current scams and
                      describe some below.

                      <h2>Advance Fee</h2>
                      <p>
                        That happens when fraudsters target victims and trick
                        them into making advance or upfront payments for goods,
                        services and/or financial gains that do not materialise.
                        Sometimes, they get people to provide bank account
                        numbers. Types of Advance Fee Fraud includes -
                        Lottery/Prize Draw Fraud, 419 Fraud, Inheritance Fraud,
                        Loan Scam, Internet Auction Fraud, Dating Romance Fraud,
                        Clairvoyant or Psychic Fraud, Work from Home Opportunity
                        Fraud, Career Opportunity Fraud, Cheque Overpayment
                        Fraud and more.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Bank Guarantee Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This involves bogus investment schemes encouraging
                        potential investors in trading prime bank instruments,
                        and promising guaranteed, risk-free high returns.
                        Fraudsters usually use complex, sophisticated but
                        official-sounding language. This may include letter of
                        credit, debentures, prime World Bank bank guarantees,
                        private funding project, and more.

                      <h2>Cheque Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        Scammers may use various ways to make bogus cheque
                        payments. Those cheques, either stolen (forged
                        signature), altered (change of recipient name) or
                        counterfeited (created on non-bank paper), are valueless
                        meaning that you would remit goods or services with no
                        money in return. Sometimes, fraudsters fake cheques with
                        a higher than the agreed value and trick you into
                        refunding them the difference.

                      <p>
                        Fraudsters rummage through trash looking for bills or
                        other papers with your personal information on
                        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                      <h2>Ponzi and Pyramid Schemes</h2>
                      <p>
                        It is a fraudulent practice that dupes investors by
                        promising above average returns in a short space of
                        time. In both schemes, fraudsters pay returns to
                        existing investors out of the money brought in by new
                        investors. Since those schemes are not supported by any
                        real investment that could generate the promised
                        returns, the schemes collapse whenever there is a
                        liquidity crisis in the system, triggered by higher
                        redemptions, or when promoters cannot raise enough money
                        from new investors to pay earlier ones. Except for the
                        criminals who started the scheme, everyone else lose
                        money!

                      <h2>Recovery Room Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This rapidly growing fraud often exploits investors who
                        have already fallen victim of another fraud like
                        Timeshare fraud. Scammers, posing as a representative of
                        a government agency or organisation that aid scam
                        victims, offer to help recover the money lost, for an
                        advance fee. This might even be carried out by the same
                        group of criminals.

                    <div>
                      <h2>Timeshare/Boiler Room Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This refers to an investment scam that works towards
                        selling you worthless, overpriced or even non-existent
                        shares. Fraudsters claim - via email, phone, post or
                        seminar - that you can easily become a share owner of a
                        property, by buying a timeshare. The property either
                        doesn’t exist or is not of the same value as advertised.
                        Sometimes, they offer you a gift or discount on their
                        dealing charges, and usually exercise pressure on you to
                        sign a contract for the timeshare. If you are already a
                        timeshare owner, fraudsters may offer to sell it on your
                        behalf, for a fee.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Vishing</h2>
                      <p>
                        Short for Voice Phishing, it is a fraudulent practice of
                        making phone calls or leaving voice messages purporting
                        to be from reputable companies in order to trick people
                        into revealing critical financial information such as
                        bank details, credit cards details or even lure them
                        into transferring money over the phone. During
                        sophisticated attacks, the criminals already know your
                        name, address, phone number - essentially the kind of
                        information you would expect a genuine caller to have. A
                        vishing attack can be conducted by voice email, VoIP
                        (voice over IP), landline or mobile phone.&nbsp;

                      <h2>Wire Transfer Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This increasingly sophisticated phishing fraud is very
                        well organised and happens to individuals and companies
                        of all sizes, and can result in significant financial
                        loss. It occurs when victims are scammed into
                        transferring money by wire transfer to a fraudster. Con
                        artists insist that people wire money – especially
                        overseas – because it’s nearly impossible to reverse the
                        transfer or trace the money.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      In attacks targeting organisations, scammers perpetrating
                      these frauds monitor and infiltrate companies. People
                      behind those attacks usually conduct thorough
                      investigation, including social engineering, to understand
                      the company’s brand, environment, activities, payment
                      procedures as well as the employees’ responsibilities,
                      habits, schedules so they know exactly who to target, how
                      and when, and in view to make the wire transfer request
                      look as credible as possible.

                    <div>
                      This con usually entails Business Email Compromise whereby
                      the attacker compromises a business executive’s email
                      account or any publicly listed email. Because of its low
                      volume highly-targeted nature, the counterfeited emails
                      usually have few of the typical markers of spam.
                      Fraudsters intercept emails using malicious software or
                      simply create fake emails, and impersonate someone from
                      the company and freely sends emails to the victims.

                      Imposters also target individuals and usually come up with
                      all kinds of convincing stories to get your money. Many of
                      them involve the victim wiring money through financial
                      institutions as well as companies like Western Union and
                      MoneyGram. Here are some examples of money wiring scams

                      <h2>CEO Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This well-established type of ‘wire transfer fraud’ uses
                        subtle means to convince specific executives with
                        adequate access to their company’s accounts to wire
                        large sums of money, increasingly reaching seven figure
                        sums. After sound research and creating spoof emails,
                        the resourceful scammers usually target the finance or
                        accountancy department and impersonate C-Level
                        executives, often the CEO, to request urgent fund
                        transfers into nominated bank accounts. Organisations
                        with international business transactions are more likely
                        to be targeted as transfers to overseas banks wouldn’t
                        stand out as suspicious.

                      <h2>Invoice Fraud</h2>
                      <p>
                        This is another variation of ‘wire transfer&#39; fraud
                        whereby scammers, impersonating a supplier for instance,
                        fraudulently request to have bank details changed,
                        claiming to have payment services shifted abroad. Very
                        often done by email, the request may be made by phone as
                        well, and the call will closely imitate a legitimate
                        request. After careful study of the targeted companies
                        and people, usually fraudsters craft correspondences so
                        the content of the email including the invoice itself
                        appear to be genuine, and similar to prior invoices from
                        real supplier - nothing out of the ordinary.

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Don’t assume an email or phone call is authentic. Always
                        check the sending email address and financial related
                        instructions contained therein and don’t trust phone
                        numbers displaying during the call as fraudsters can
                        make any phone number appear on an handset. Confirm the
                        email or call genuineness by calling the company back on
                        the official phone number which you may already have on
                        file.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Always look out for any irregularities on invoices
                        including a change of name, bank details, amount or
                        address. Be suspicious if it differs from the last time
                        you used it and confirm any changes with the company
                        requesting the amendment by using contact details you
                        already have on record.

                        Don’t click on ‘reply’ to answer back. Instead, use the
                        ‘forward&#39; feature and key in your correspondent’s
                        email address you have on file. This will ensure that
                        you are not, in fact, responding to any potential
                        scammer.

                      <p>
                        Another alternative form of this fraud is simply when
                        fraudsters claiming to be a member of a family or friend
                        who needs cash for an emergency — like hospital fees,
                        robbed during an overseas trip or even to get out of
                        jail. The con person begs the prey - by email, instant
                        message or phone - to wire money right away, and usually
                        insist on keeping the situation secret.
